# Better Inventory — Steam Workshop Copy

This file contains ready-to-paste copy and the release checklist for
`v0.5.0-rc1`. It is not loaded by the mod.

## Title

Better Inventory

## Short description

Expanded inventory, dedicated equipment slots, deterministic sorting, manual
slot locks, bag sorting, and Quick Stack — with server-authoritative item
movement.

## Workshop description

[h1]Better Inventory[/h1]

Better Inventory expands and organizes the Don't Starve Together inventory
without moving item authority away from the server.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[list]
[*]Optional 24-slot main inventory with a compact 2 x 12 layout
[*]Separate optional Bag, Armor, and Accessory equipment slots
[*]Deterministic category sorting with optional stack merging
[*]Independent sorting for the equipped bag, even while its UI is closed
[*]Persistent manual slot locks for items you want to keep in place
[*]Quick Stack into compatible stacks already present in the equipped bag
[*]Configurable hotkeys and inventory UI scale
[*]Server-side cooldowns, transaction guards, and item recovery
[/list]

[h2]Default controls[/h2]

[table]
[tr][th]Input[/th][th]Action[/th][/tr]
[tr][td]F5[/td][td]Sort the main inventory[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]F6[/td][td]Sort the equipped bag[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]F7[/td][td]Quick Stack matching items into existing bag stacks[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Hover a main slot + L[/td][td]Toggle that slot's sort lock[/td][/tr]
[/table]

All hotkeys can be changed in the mod configuration. Conflicting inventory
hotkeys are detected and the secondary action is disabled instead of running
two operations at once.

[h2]Quick Stack behavior[/h2]

Quick Stack only fills compatible stacks that already exist in the equipped
bag. It does not introduce a new item type into the bag. Locked source slots
are skipped, and leftovers return to their original main-inventory slot.

[h2]Multiplayer[/h2]

This is an all-clients mod: the server and every joining player must install and
enable the same version. Inventory movement, sorting, locks, and Quick Stack are
validated by the server.

[h2]Release candidate notice[/h2]

Version 0.5.0-rc1 has passed single-player, host, dedicated-server loading, and
automated sorting regression tests. Full two-client late-join, reconnect, and
Forest/Caves traversal validation is still in progress. Back up important
worlds before testing a release candidate.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Better Inventory targets Don't Starve Together API version 10. Existing
v0.2.6+ saves remain compatible. Mods that replace the inventory HUD, change
the base inventory size, or redefine equipment slots may conflict.

[h2]Feedback and bug reports[/h2]

Please include the host and client logs, enabled mod list, world type, and exact
steps needed to reproduce the problem.

## Change notes

[h1]v0.5.0-rc1[/h1]

[list]
[*]Added Quick Stack to compatible stacks already present in the equipped bag.
[*]Added independent equipped-bag sorting that works with the bag UI closed.
[*]Added persistent manual main-inventory slot locks.
[*]Made condition and equal-item sorting deterministic across repeated sorts.
[*]Added server-side cooldown, re-entrancy, recovery, and protocol diagnostics.
[*]Added automated regression coverage for sorting and Quick Stack behavior.
[/list]

This is a release candidate. Full two-client late-join, reconnect, and
cross-shard validation is still pending.

## Recommended Workshop visibility

Publish `v0.5.0-rc1` as **Friends Only** or **Unlisted** while completing the
two-client validation matrix. Switch to **Public** when issue #3 is complete and
the final `v0.5.0` build is tagged.

## Preview and screenshot plan

Use a square preview image that remains legible at thumbnail size. Recommended
screenshot order:

1. Compact 24-slot inventory plus the three dedicated equipment slots.
2. Before/after main-inventory category sort.
3. A locked slot with its overlay visible.
4. Equipped bag before/after bag sort.
5. Quick Stack before/after, showing that no new item type enters the bag.

Do not use debug chat or developer overlays in the Workshop screenshots.
